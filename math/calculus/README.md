# Learning Objectives

1. **Summation and Product notation**: Summation notation is a method used to represent or express large sums in a compact form. It uses the Greek capital letter Sigma (Σ) to represent the sum. Product notation is similar, but it represents the product of a sequence and uses the Greek capital letter Pi (Π).

2. **What is a series?**: A series is the sum of the terms of a sequence. It can be finite or infinite.

3. **Common series**: Common series include arithmetic series (where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference to the preceding term), geometric series (where each term after the first is obtained by multiplying the preceding term by a fixed, non-zero number), and harmonic series (the sum of the reciprocals of the positive integers).

4. **What is a derivative?**: A derivative measures how a function changes as its input changes. It's a fundamental concept in calculus.

5. **What is the product rule?**: The product rule is a formula used to find the derivatives of products of two or more functions.

6. **What is the chain rule?**: The chain rule is a formula to compute the derivative of a composite function.

7. **Common derivative rules**: Common rules include the power rule, product rule, quotient rule, chain rule, and rules for trigonometric functions.

8. **What is a partial derivative?**: A partial derivative of a function of several variables is its derivative with respect to one of those variables, with the others held constant.

9. **What is an indefinite integral?**: An indefinite integral, also known as an antiderivative, is a function whose derivative is the original function. It represents the reverse process of differentiation.

10. **What is a definite integral?**: A definite integral calculates the net area between the function and the x-axis over a certain interval. It's used in many areas of mathematics and physics.

11. **What is a double integral?**: A double integral allows us to calculate the volume under a surface as defined by a function of two variables. It's an extension of the concept of a definite integral.
